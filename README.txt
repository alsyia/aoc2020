This repository contains my solution to AOC 2020 challenge. This is mostly quick and dirty code which could be optimized a lot in some cases.
I sometimes voluntarily took a longer path (for example regexes instead of a bunch of split) just because I wanted to explore a specific way to solve the problem.
